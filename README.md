# Scala-Project-1

## Project Description

This project demonstrates Hive queries using Scala, Spark, Apache Zeppelin, and Intellij based upon user input.

## Technologies Used

* IntelliJ Idea (IDE)
* Scala (version 2.11.12)
* Spark (version 3.1.2)
* SBT (version 1.6.2)
* Github
* Github Desktop
* Excel
* Apache Zeppelin (version 0.10.0)

## Features
List of Features
* Created admin and guest accounts for project.
* Created a user friendly menu to handle user inputs.
* Query database using user input for dates and cities input by user. 
* Query future temperature predictions using dates and cities input by user.
* View machine learning model to show it's accuracy through menu option 7.
* MySQL used in zeppelin to generate viusalizations of data.

To do List
* Add additional cities to the data selected.
* Add additional years to the data.
* Create spark streaming capability to automatically add to the database.

## Getting Started

To get started, first clone the repository to your desktop/laptop by using the http link given. Using git bash, type git clone https://github.com/Zero-AB/Project_Two.git into the command line. The project was created using IntelliJ and can be downloaded using the following link: [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) Once downloaded, start IntelliJ and use it to open the project folder and navigate to the climate object under the src folder inside the project. From there, you are able to run main and begin using the project. 

## Usage

After running main, you may select an option from the menu that is given. Options include querying a database for highest average temperature for a given month in a given city over 25 years, average temp and CO2 emissions per year, average temperature between given dates and given city, and a machine learning model to predict future temperatures.
